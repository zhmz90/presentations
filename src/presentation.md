### Background
    Foucus on machine learning 
    愚公移山:three mountatians ==> one mountatian
    MLer() = compute_ability(HPC) + algorithm(OPT) + model(DL,PGM,ML,Boosting etc) 
    iterative, coordinate ascent and active learning:
       iterative: again, again, again, ....  
       coordinate ascent: a simple heuristic algorithm, optimize one while fixed the others.
       active learning: learn what you like, learn what you are capable of, and valuable of...

    minimize: the height of three mountatians
    subject to: ∑time_i = 10000hours  
                keep other states relatively stable and persistant
